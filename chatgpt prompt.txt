TEXT: It was a hectic day at work, and since I was behind on preparing drinks, I decided to push through. With support from my coworkers, I managed to complete all the orders before my break. Initially, the volume of drinks was overwhelming, but I felt relieved once everything was done. My responsibilities included preparing drinks and ensuring all supplies were well-stocked. I learned that even in stressful situations, I can manage effectively with teamwork. One thing I would do differently next time is check and restock supplies more promptly.
