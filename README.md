# Livedx_Student-Experiential-Essays

ABSTRACT
Recognizing the Social Determinants of Mental Health (SDMHs) among students is essential, as lower backgrounds in these determinants elevate the risk of poor academic achievement, behavioral issues, and physical health problems, thereby affecting both physical and emotional well-being. Leveraging students’ self-reported lived experiential essays yields substantial insights into the SDMHs. However, constructing an automated prediction tool for SDMHs necessitates thorough planning, efficient design of a web-based tool for data collection, articulation of SDMHs within the context of lived experiences, expert data annotation, and the implementation of an efficient multi-label classifier for prediction. This paper investigates the capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) in the development of a multi-label SDMHs prediction system in students’ lived experiential essays covering the above aspects. In this regard, we propose a novel Human-LLM Interaction for Annotation (HLIA) method to label texts pertaining to predetermined SDMHs and develop a Multitask Cascaded Neural Network (MTCNN) classification algorithm to predict these determinants in students’ experiential essays. Additionally, we developed a web-tool based lived experience essay data collection system, developed a dataset of ˜1  500 lived experiential essays collected from 800+ students annotated by 4 educational experts (IRB approved) and evaluated the proposed framework.
